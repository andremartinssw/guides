# Demo for Room Previews using Programmable Video Rooms

This minimal demo uses Programmable Video Rooms and SignalWire Video REST APIs to fetch and preview room previews.

To run this demo locally, make necessary adjustments ot the env.example file and rename it to `.env`. You can get the `PROJECT_ID` and `API_TOKEN` from your SignalWire Dashboard.

Once you have made the adjustments, install the dependencies using `yarn install` and then start it via `yarn dev`.
